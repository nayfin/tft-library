Breaking changes will accur often and documentation will be limited.\nMajor versions will attempt to keep in line with Angular releases and we will keep past major versions available on branches in the repository\nGenerate Documentation\nWe use the fantastic compodoc library to generate our documentation. Simply run npm run compodoc:lib from the root folder to build and serve library docs locally on localhost:8080, or run npm run compodoc:app to build and serve sandbox app docs at localhost:8081. We are fleshing out the docs more everyday so definitions and examples should become the norm for all modules. It does have trouble watching for changes so you may need to rerun regulary if you're expecting the documentation to keep up while developing.\nModules:\nDesignModule:\nImports and exports all @angular/material componenst and @angular/flex-layout to be used with components for this library. Can be used to import all components into the app code if desired.\nSearchModule:\nA library of customized angular-instantsearch components built with @angular/material library.\nComponents:\n\nsearch-box: Filters  using text search. Defaults to \"[searchOnKeyUp]=\"true\".\n\npagination: Simple pagination interface to page through .\n\nautocomplete: Emits selected item from autocompleting form input.\n\nfilter-select: Allows to easily refine search instance by binding to a facet (a facet can be created via algolia console). Pass attributeName as an input parameter, with the name of the facet on which you would like to filter. Pass [multiple]=\"true\" to allow selection of multiple facet values on which to filter.\n\nfilter-chiplist: Similar to  but consists of an autocompleting chiplist, with the results of  limited to filter on values of selected chips.\n\nalgolia-attribution: 'Powered by Algolia' attribution to display where necesarry\nBetter documentation of component usage will be available in coming months, but for now examples of usage can be found in the repository under /src/app/examples.\n\n\nDynamicFormModule ( BETA: Regular breaking changes until stabilized. ETA: late October )\nA module design to generate forms when passed a JSON configuration. Created following this excellent guide by Todd Motto. Some parameter names have been changed from his guide to allow for future features, so this won't work as a drop in imlementation to following the guide. Currently, this is only a very basic implementation, but we want to greatly expand the capabilities of this module.\nUsage\nIn component.html\n\n      \n      \n    In component.ts\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Validators, FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { ConditionalFieldsService } from 'projects/tft-library/src/lib/dynamic-form/conditional-fields.service';\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs';\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n// import { SelectFieldConfig } from 'projects/tft-library/src/lib/dynamic-form/form-select/select-field-config';\n// import { InputFieldConfig } from 'projects/tft-library/src/lib/dynamic-form/form-input/input-field-config';\nimport { AnyFieldConfig, FormConfig } from 'projects/tft-library/src/lib/dynamic-form/dynamic-field-config';\n\n/**\n * Custom rxjs operator determines if string is blank after trim\n *\n * returns false if blank else true\n */\nconst isNotBlank = () => map( (value: string) => !!value.trim().length );\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-dynamic-form',\n  templateUrl: './dynamic-form.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./dynamic-form.component.scss']\n})\nexport class DynamicFormComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  // the config holds an array of configurations for the fields you want to create\n  // TODO: was types as AnyControlConfig[] but recursive implementation broke the type.

Recently, the Angular Instanstsearch team documented how to create custom widgets, which gives us the benifits of feature release and bug fixes performed by them as well as the ability to create costom Material Design components that easily utilize InstantSearch. Unfortunately, this created some break changes, but most are easy to fix with a simple find-replace from your IDE.\nChanges\n\nNeed to import { NgAisModule } from 'angular-instantsearch' in modules that consume tft-search components and add to imports array of module\n -> \n -> \n -> \nPlease post an issue if you have difficulty upgrading se we can update documentation.\nThe old library is available here. There are no plans to maintain as the structure of the library has made it overly difficult to test, debug, and integrate into applications. Moving forward we plan on providing bug fixes and light maintenance for each major release for two major release cycles e.g. v6 will be maintained until v8 is release.\n\n\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.0.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
